% Create mapping matrixes to convert ambisonic to different speaker layouts supported in Qt Multimedia
%
% This uses the ADT octave framework from https://bitbucket.org/ambidecodertoolbox/adt/src/master/
% to generate conversion matrixes between ambisonic formats and various speaker configurations
%
% We're generating two band conversion matrices with a cutoff frequency of 380 Herz. Filtering low
% and high frequencies differently is important to get a decent spatial reproduction. For details
% see the "Is my decoder Ambisonic?" paper (https://ambisonics.dreamhosters.com/BLaH3.pdf)
%
function adt_generate_qt()
    % assume speakers are 2 meters from listener. This should avoid near-field
    % effects and should work for most room setups
