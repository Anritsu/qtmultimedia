\title Spatial Audio Panning Example
\ingroup spatialaudio_examples
\meta {tag} {widgets}
\brief Shows some of the capabilities of the spatial audio engine in Qt.

The Spatial Audio Example demonstrates how you can use \l{Qt Spatial Audio} to
place sound sources in 3D space and how positioning of the sound source and
room properties affect the listening experience.

The example lets you specify a sound file to be played back at a certain
position in 3D space relative to the listener. Using sliders you can change
the distance and the azimuth and elevation angles to the source. You can also
change dimensions of a virtual room, the intensity of the room reflections
and reverb.

Various other properties can also be modified such as the dimensions of a virtual
room and the intensity of the room reflections and reverb.
